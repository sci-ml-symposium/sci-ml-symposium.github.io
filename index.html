She earned her M.A. in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from the university, and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego. Her broad research interests involve scientific machine learning (SciML) including theory, algorithms, and applications to real life problems. She has worked on the interdisciplinary methods across PINNs, operator learning and federated learning, where she applied data-driven methods constrained by physical knowledge to solve PDEs or learn differential operators. More recently, She's working on developing and applying scalable machine learning approaches, numerical methods and federated learning for analyzing high-dimensional data.

He was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT before joining GaTech, and earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University.
                He leads a research group with the goal to extend the horizon of accurate models for the optimization of engineering solutions.  For example, introducing models where trial and error and heuristics are the state of the art for practitioners. His group develops fast approximate PDE models and scientific machine learning models that combine AI models and scientific models, end to end. These new models enable the ressource-efficient and large-scale optimization of engineering solutions in the following areas:

                <li>Inverse design in electromagnetism , up to a billion design parameters.</li>
                <li>Co-design of physical hardware and software.</li>
