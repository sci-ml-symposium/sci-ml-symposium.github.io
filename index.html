    <h2>About Sci-ML Symposium</h2>
    <p>
        The inaugural student-focused scientific machine learning (SciML) symposium at Georgia Tech is dedicated to the development and applications of SciML methodologies led by current students in a wide array of applications such as weather forecast, public health predictions, SciML models for materials science, drug discovery, financial prediction, astrophysics, and robotics, to name a few. The primary goal of this symposium is to showcase student talents and contributions through the invited and contributed talks. Although this symposium is student-focused, everyone is welcome to attend irrespective of their student status. This event originated from the graduate Special Topics Course on SciML at Georgia Tech. In compliance with FERPA, only the group names (rather than the author names) will be provided in the schedule for the projects that were conducted by the students of the course. 

    </p>

        <span style="color:rgb(202, 82, 22);">Code of Conduct</span>:

        The organizational staff of the SciML Symposium is committed to providing a positive symposium experience for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or national and ethnic origin. We encourage respectful and considerate interactions between attendees and do not tolerate harassment of symposium participants in any form. Symposium participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from the symposium at the discretion of the symposium organizers.

She earned her M.A. in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from the university, and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego. Her broad research interests involve scientific machine learning (SciML) including theory, algorithms, and applications to real life problems. She has worked on the interdisciplinary methods across PINNs, operator learning and federated learning, where she applied data-driven methods constrained by physical knowledge to solve PDEs or learn differential operators. More recently, She's working on developing and applying scalable machine learning approaches, numerical methods and federated learning for analyzing high-dimensional data.

Put simply: stop learning principles you already know – save the learning for the hard bits.

He was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT before joining GaTech, and earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University.
                He leads a research group with the goal to extend the horizon of accurate models for the optimization of engineering solutions.  For example, introducing models where trial and error and heuristics are the state of the art for practitioners. His group develops fast approximate PDE models and scientific machine learning models that combine AI models and scientific models, end to end. These new models enable the ressource-efficient and large-scale optimization of engineering solutions in the following areas:

                <li>Inverse design in electromagnetism , up to a billion design parameters.</li>
                <li>Co-design of physical hardware and software.</li>
